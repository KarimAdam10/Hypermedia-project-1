I made the CV about me. First I decided and thought about how to structure and distribute the CV. Once the distribution was decided, I made the html with their respective tags. For conlusion, with the html I had a non-stylized structure so to finish I decided how to style the html (colors, sizes, typologies, etc).

Project analysis: 
The final user will be a human esources worker for example who expect that my CV will help him get to know me and my aptitudes, qualities, experience, etc.
Information architecture: in this project, which is assumed to be a singlepage project, this analysis isnâ€™t very relevant.
Visual design: I have not wanted to be very flashy or use very dark colors because I think I am interested in appearing discreet even though the opposite could attract the attention of the worker. I have chosen the typology verdana because I think it's pretty formal. In the distribution I have differentiated between the information that the reader is interested in and needs to know and the data to contact me in the event that they like my characteristics. That's why the data and my goals are on the left in a separate light blue column.
